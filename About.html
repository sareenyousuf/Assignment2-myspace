  <h3>WELCOME!</h3>
  <p>Hey! Welcome to my Space, a place I like to call my mind. You can treat me as an open book while at the same time to change who I am. This space is for you to enter my mind of thought and see my perspectives of my world but in a laptop format.</p>
  <p>The motive of this space is for me to show you the sides of me I am most comfortable with. I want people to feel like they know most of me but at the same time have a sort of mystery about me.</p>
  <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
  <p>For all of you who don't know me. Hey, I am Sareen Yousuf! I was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan and now I am in Toronto, Canada for my futher studies. I am currently in the second year of university, at Ontario College of Art and Design, studying Graphic Design.</p>
  <p> The reason why I chose Graphic Design was because it led me to a world of exploration. Being able to be in a world where communcation is a heavy key carries a lot of baggage. Since I was a child I have always been an ominvert but now Graphic Design has given that road to communicate to the world with my mind. The world of design allows me to be in a place where I can add my own thoughts while rendering other peoples thoughts. It is a all a mind game which truely increases my seratonin levels.</p>
