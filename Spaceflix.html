">I was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan. Pakistan has always been home to me and is one of the most unique places to live in. Pakistan has its own ability to shine like no other place. Having this culture within me I am glad to call myself a Pakistani. Pakistan has its own way to make everyone, even vistora, to feel like they jumped into the life of thrill. With its serene nature and astonishing monuments this is one of the few places that takes my breathe away. This country has taught me nothing but purity which suprisingly is also the meaning of this country.    </p>

">Nothing beats life than getting amazing food in the system. Just like how every human needs food to survive to me food has more value. Combining foods from different cultures and embracing their taste is what amazes me. To me food is that one item that helps through every emotion. It's amazing how we crave such foods when in reality that taste in your mouth is temporary and vanishes within seconds. However, we still have prefences and crave a bag of items.    </p>

">Tv Shows for me have always been that space where I can forget the world and just relax on my own. Since alot of elements happen in life at times I feel like having a time to myself is essential. I have always been the type of girl who would easily get hooked on to any show. For me the shows that connect with me are mostly crime and suspense. It is always those shows that make me want to wonder every step and truely forget about anything in the background. At times I also aim for the light show to just get a little laugh.   </p>

">Vacations for me have always been a dip in the ocean. Traveling for me is an exceptionally vital piece of life as it is the most ideal approach to escape the bustling timetable. Traveling is a decent solution for stress, tension and discouragement. I have just got one life and I ought to express its gratitude. In addition to the fact that we get to encounter the excellence of nature, various geologies, geographies, and individuals. Along with that my vacations have to include beaches and ocean as their presence means a ton to me.   </p>

">Having a getaway for life is something essential for me. Since we all got one life I want to spend it by doing thrilling things in life. For a while I have been acustomed to a routine where I do the same things everyday but at times I want to explore the things I haven't done. Whether its facing my fears or doing the impossible to jump out of my comfort zone brings strength in me in no other way. Having the ability to check down the items I have accomplished make me feel like a different person each time.   </p>
