  <p style="text-align:center/right;">In my life time as been one the most essential components. Since I was a young I would have memories of looking at the time and just get lost on how slow time goes. At that time I wanted to do nothing but grow up. As I am grown up now I wish I could go back in time and wish not to grow up. When growing older you recognize how fast time is going and just wanna slow down the times.</p>
 <p> Until now I did not understand how time becomes an essence to our life. Time is the only place where I can learn to grow, heal, and engage into the human I am today. With time there comes patience and with patience creates a spirit of personality. Even though there are times I which to go back but then understand that it is in the past and time does nothing but go forward. The time that have now is the only time I will get to work on myself and shape myself in the human I want to be.
